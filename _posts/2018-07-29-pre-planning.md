This is a post that will be relatable only by my team, and that's okay. 

Pre-planning, sometimes called grooming or estimation, is a meeting held by our project manager that follows the Agile methodology. We estimate the complexity of tasks for the upcoming sprints, using Jira stories.

This re-write of Free Falling was inspired by a particular pre-planning meeting in which, as a storm approached Boston, I was estimating tickets inconsistent with the rest of the team. The point of pre-planning is of course not to match your teammates estimate, but it does feel a bit funny to be the odd engineer out.

The storm was underwhelming by the way, but the cloud was menacing. 

Pre-Plannning

It’s a good story,
Has acceptance criteria,
A good title,
And a description too

It’s a good story,
Has a high ROI,
It’s in an epic
That we like too

It’s a long hour, sitting in Baklava
There’s a storm cloud, about to pour
And I’m a bad engineer
Cause I can’t guess correctly
I’m a bad engineer
For throwing an eight

And I’m pre, pre-planning
And I’m pre, pre-planning

All my teammates, throwing their cards down
Shut down and move to the door
All the bad tickets are sittin in the backlog
And the good tickets are going in the sprint

And I’m pre, pre-planning
And I’m pre, pre-planning
