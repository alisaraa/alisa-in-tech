This is a post that will be relatable only by my team, and that's okay. 

Pre-planning, sometimes called grooming or estimation, is a meeting held by our project manager that follows the Agile methodology. We estimate the complexity of tasks for the upcoming sprints, using Jira stories.

This re-write of Free Falling was inspired by a particular pre-planning meeting in which, as a storm approached Boston, I was estimating tickets inconsistent with the rest of the team. The point of pre-planning is of course not to match your teammates estimate, but it does feel a bit funny to be the odd engineer out.

The storm was underwhelming by the way, but the cloud was menacing.

Pre-Planning

It’s a good story,<br>
Has acceptance,<br>
A good title,<br>
And a description too<br>

It’s a good story,<br>
Has a high ROI,<br>
It’s in an epic<br>
That we like too<br>

It’s a long hour, sitting in Baklava<br>
There’s a storm cloud, about to pour<br>
And I’m a bad engineer<br>
Cause I can’t guess correctly<br>
I’m a bad engineer<br>
For throwing an eight<br>

And I’m pre, pre-planning<br>
And I’m pre, pre-planning<br>

All my teammates, throwing their cards down<br>
Shut down and move to the door<br>
All the bad tickets are sittin in the backlog<br>
And the good tickets are going in the sprint<br>

And I’m pre, pre-planning<br>
And I’m pre, pre-planning<br>
